After making changes to the codebase, run the following commands to ensure quality:

1. **Run Checks (Typecheck & Lint)**:

   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

   This runs both `tsc` validation and `eslint`.

2. **Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. **Format Code**:

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

Ensure all commands pass successfully before considering the task complete.
